# safegraph_census_wrangle
R code to wrangle Safegraph's Open Census Data to extract a host of useful socio-economic and demographic variables.

Just place the safegraph files (downloadable [here](https://www.safegraph.com/free-data/open-census-data)) in the "data/in" directory, open the R project from a local repositry, and run the 00_master.R file. 

The wrangled data will appear in the out folder.
